### Description
This online application predicts the next value in a user-inputted numerical sequence using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.  The model processes an input series of values such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 and returns the projected next value, which in this example is 0.23771484.  The pattern that the LSTM has discovered from its training data—which may include non-linear or time-dependent trends—is reflected in its output.  The forecast captures the temporal dynamics found in the dataset the model was trained on, as opposed to merely continuing a linear development.
